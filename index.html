    <h2 id="Step1"> Step 1: Starting Out </h2>

    <a href="Images/https://github.com/new"> Head over to github and create a repository in your name, if you do not
        have a github account, create one! </a>

    <img src="Images/NewRepository.png" id="NewRepository">
    <p> Properly name your repository as "Username/Username.github.io"</p>
    

    <p> After creating a repository create your first codespace </p>
    
    <div class="Image-Container">
    <img src="Images/CreateCodeSpace.png" alt="codespace">
    </div>

    <p> Now you should be here! </p>
    <img src="Images/CheckPoint.png" id="CheckPoint">

    <h2> Step 2: Setting up Your Codespace </h2>

    <p> First create two files, name one html.index and the other style.css </p>
    <img src="Images/NewIndex.png" id="NewIndex">
    <img src="Images/NewStyleFile.png" id="NewStyle">

    <p> Second, to exstensions, search up "Live Server", and install it </p>
    <img src="Images/DownloadLiveServer.png" id="">
    <p> Now you can see a live version of your website if you right click index.html and click "Open with LiveServer"
    </p>

    <p> Lastly, you want to change your theme go to exstentions and search theme untill you find <br/>
        the theme exstension.
    </p>

    <img src="Images/Theme Exstention.png">

    <p> go back to the html.index file and create the "structure" of this file </p>
    <img src="Images/HtmlStructure4.png" id="IndexStructure">
    <p> The "body" and "head" are known as tags, I will refer to them as containers however <br>
        In the head tag connect the style file to your html file and <br/> 
         set your page title. The body tag will hold most of your text.
    </p>

    <h2> Step 3: Adding Content </h2>

    <p> Adding a header is quite simple, use this code to make one. Headers have
        different sizes, ranging from h1 to h6.
    </p>

    <img src="Images/HeaderWebPage.png">

    <p> To create a new paragraph type the underlined code in your body container </p>
    <img src="Images/Creating a paragraph.png">

    <p> Now if you want to add an an image you need to <br/>
        download an image off the internet then upload it to the explorer. </p>
    <img src="Images/Uploading an image.png">

    <p> Then use this code to add your image to your website.</p>

    <img src="Images/Image Code.png">
    <p> Refresh your website and your image should be there </p>

    <p> Go over to your style.css file and lets add some style! </p>

    <img src="Images/Body style.png">
    <p> This code will act as the default settings for everyting
        inside of the body. Unless you use an Id to change a specific line text
        your code inside the body tags will use these default settings
    </p>

    <p> to edit a specific text or image you first have to add an id then in the CSS file <br/>
         add style to it </p>

    <img src="Images/IdCSS.png">
    <img src="Images/IdHtml.png">

    <p> your website should now look a bit like this </p>
    <img src="Images/IdShowcase.png">

    <h2> Step 4: Go beyond plus ultra! </h2>

    <p> at this point you could submit and call it a day or
        you could challenge yourself to be creative and add your own
        spin on your website. <br> You could create a recipe website, your very own
        portfolio, or a blog. Ask me or google it if you have any questions.
    </p>

    <h2> Step 5: Submitting </h2>
    <p> Before you submit make sure you sync and commit your files </p>
